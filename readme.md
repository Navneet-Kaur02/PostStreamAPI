# PostStreamAPI

PostStreamAPI is a simple project that replicates the core functionality of a content posting platform, similar to Quora. It allows users to create, edit, and delete posts using RESTful APIs. This project focuses on functionality rather than design and uses an array to store data instead of a database.

## Features
- Create new posts
- Edit existing posts
- Delete posts
- Retrieve all posts

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Data Storage
This project uses an array to store data instead of a traditional database. The array is used to keep track of posts and their associated data. This approach is suitable for demonstration purposes but is not intended for production use.
